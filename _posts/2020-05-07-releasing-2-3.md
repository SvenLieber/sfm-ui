SFM version 2.3 is our #StayAtHome release, completed while the team was working remotely in the midst of the pandemic. We hope you and your families are staying well. 

This release of SFM includes updates to both key back-end components and the front end. Most notably, the user interface has been improved for accessibility. We also migrated to Bootstrap 4 and added a new calendar widget in form fields. Since SFM uses cookies, we've introduced an optional, configurable cookie consent popup. 

Back-end upgrades include migrating to Django 2.2 and updating the Postgres database to version 9.6. 
**Note that there are required manual steps to upgrade an existing database before upgrading SFM.**  

See [the release notes](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-docker/releases/tag/2.3.0) for more details, and in particular for instructions for upgrading the database and enabling the optional features.
